title: "Thoughts on Art Improvement"
date: 2019-12-23

  I like to mindlessly doodle similar subjects and poses over and over again. It’s kind of like comfort food— safe and reassuring. However, these mindless doodles never challenge me. And the more I draw the same subjects, the more bored I get. 
<br> <br> 
Lately, I want to challenge myself when it comes to drawing. I’ve seen other artists 10 year drawing comparisons, with wild amounts of improvement. Now, I know every artists have there different journey: some pursue art professionally, some artists take classes, etc. However, seeing other people’s development in draftsmanship makes me feel lacking? Maybe that’s a little too negative, so let me reframe this thought: in terms of art improvement, I could do better. I want to do better.
<br> <br>  
So, from there: how do I get better at drawing? Well, first off: practice makes perfect. So far, all my practice has been mindless. I want to change that… I want to practice being intentional and purposeful. Some goals I have are to: 
<br> <br> 1. Identify my influences
<br> 2. Brainstorm ideas, Explore new subjects/themes
<br> 3. Challenge myself w/ line art, perspective, expression
<br> 4. Try out new mediums
<br> 5. Be patient, but consistent
