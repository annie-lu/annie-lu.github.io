      <br/> CMSC250 resources are not shown, because it include private practice problem solutions. <br/> <br/> 

I believe in having thoroughly prepared, organized material for tutoring. This way when students have particular questions, I can quickly provide practice problems and examples. I also can hand out notes and recap emails, so students recall/understand everything taught during tutoring sessions.
