    My Teaching Philosophy <br/>
    My teaching philosophy is to foster a growth mindset and embrace varying computer science knowledge backgrounds. What I mean by growth mindset is: the belief that, through hard work and dedication, any student can learn fundamental computer science concepts. Emphasizing growth mindset can be done using two practices: (1) Challenging societal perceptions that woman/minorities are less ‚Äúlogical‚Äù and not fit for STEM fields (2) Celebrating on improvement rather than talent. By having this mindset, I hope my students have the confidence to strive for success. Another part of my teaching philosophy is helping people with any computer science background. I take time to respond to questions and try to guide students through problems. By seeing another student‚Äôs process, I am more likely to identify any missing gaps in knowledge to fill them in on. After tutoring, I provide notes to go over.

    On Diversity <br/>Computing and technology are shaping the future. When only a limited demographic is involved in this process, bias and disadvantages are exacerbated within technological products. To stop this from happening, we must give minorities the opportunity to collaborate and have their voices heard in tech. This way, technology can be accessible and helpful for all. By creating a more diverse community, not only will we be empowered through shaping a better technological future, but also comforted and supported by the presence of people with similar identities. Whether it be through women mentors, POC professors, or differently abled role models in tech, a diverse computing community will challenge people‚Äôs perceptions on who belongs in STEM fields. This will in turn improve the treatment of current minorities in tech. 
<br/> <br/> 
Ultimately, as an asian american woman, I contribute to such a community by bringing my own life experience and empathy towards minorities in tech. I listen to other minorities voices and try improving my behavior to become more inclusive, respectful, and understanding. I have also gone through similar struggles people seeking MCWIC tutoring may currently deal with. By serving as a helpful resource and relatable role model, I can help students overcome challenges instead of feeling discouraged. 

    
    

I‚Äôm currently a sophomore studying computer science at University of Maryland, College Park. I tutor at <a href="https://mcwic.cs.umd.edu" class="link underline black bg-animate hover-bg-washed-red">Maryland Center for Women in Computing</a>. 
<br/> <br/> 
This past fall, I started working on data science and learning/analyzing algorithms. I am also involved in a sustainability program, <a href="http://etescholars.weebly.com" class="link black bg-animate underline hover-bg-washed-red">Environment, Technology, and Economy Scholars</a>. 
<br/> <br/>
