   Hello! Iâ€™m Annie. ðŸ‘‹<br/> <br/>

      
Currently, Iâ€™m a junior studying computer science at University of Maryland, College Park. I'm passionate about tech for social good & sustainability! 
    <br/> <br/>
      Previously, I was an organizer for the worlds largest women & nonbinary student hackathon, <a href="https://gotechnica.org" class="link underline black bg-animate hover-bg-washed-red">Technica</a>.
      I also was a Software Engineer Intern at <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/capital-one-unveils-new-technology-incubator-at-the-university-of-maryland-to-foster-ai-and-machine-72daa86aad2b" class="link underline black bg-animate hover-bg-washed-red">Capital One</a> and a tutor at <a href="https://mcwic.cs.umd.edu/inclusion" class="link underline black bg-animate hover-bg-washed-red">the Iribe Initiative for Inclusion & Diversity in Computing</a>.
<br/> <br/>
      
<br/> <br/>
During my free time, I love to draw, study typography & design principles, and sing along to Mitski songs.
