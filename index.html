   Hey there! Iâ€™m Annie. ðŸ‘‹<br/> <br/>

Iâ€™m currently a junior studying computer science at University of Maryland, College Park. I'm passionate about tech for social good & sustainability! I work at <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/capital-one-unveils-new-technology-incubator-at-the-university-of-maryland-to-foster-ai-and-machine-72daa86aad2b" class="link underline black bg-animate hover-bg-washed-red">Capital One</a> as a Software Engineer Intern and tutor at <a href="https://mcwic.cs.umd.edu/inclusion" class="link underline black bg-animate hover-bg-washed-red">the Iribe Initiative for Inclusion & Diversity in Computing</a>.
<br/> <br/>
This past spring, I focused on expanding my knowledge of programming language paradigms. I also completed a sustainability program, <a href="http://etescholars.weebly.com" class="link black bg-animate underline hover-bg-washed-red">Environment, Technology, and Economy Scholars</a>.
<br/> <br/>
During my free time, I love to draw, study typography & design principles, and listen to Mitski.
