      Hello! Iâ€™m Annie. ðŸ‘‹<br/> <br/>

Iâ€™m a rising senior studying Computer Science, and the design director for <a href="https://gotechnica.org" class="link underline b--black-80 bg-animate hover-bg-washed-red">Technica 2020</a>. I'm passionate about tech for social good & sustainability! 
<br/> <br/>
Previously, I worked at <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/capital-one-unveils-new-technology-incubator-at-the-university-of-maryland-to-foster-ai-and-machine-72daa86aad2b" class="link underline b--black-80 bg-animate hover-bg-washed-red">Capital One</a> during the Summer/Fall of 2019. I also was a teaching assistant and tutor for <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2020/cmsc351/" class="link underline b--black-80 bg-animate hover-bg-washed-red">CMSC351 (Algorithms)</a>. This Summer Iâ€™ll be interning at Bank of America as a Global Technology Analyst. 
<br/> <br/>
Iâ€™m currently looking for Fall/Spring internships and apprenticeships (both Tech & Design)! Feel free to email me at annielu[at]umd.edu or contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annielu2/"  class="link underline b--black-80 bg-animate hover-bg-washed-red">LinkedIn</a>!

During my free time, I love to draw, study typography & design principles, and sing along to Mitski songs.
