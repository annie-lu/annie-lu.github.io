      Hello! Iâ€™m Annie. ðŸ‘‹<br/> <br/>
I study computer science at University of Maryland. 
<br/> <br/>
Currently, Iâ€™m the Design Director for <a href="https://gotechnica.org" class="link underline black-80 bg-animate hover-bg-washed-red"> Technica</a>, the worldâ€™s largest women & nonbinary hackathon. I also TA for our Algorithms course (CMSC351). In the past, Iâ€™ve worked at Bank of America and Capital One as a Software Engineer Intern. 
<br/> <br/>
Iâ€™m passionate about the intersection of design and code! 
<br/> <br/>
Feel free to reach out at annielu[at]umd.edu. Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to practice and improve my frontend development skills!
