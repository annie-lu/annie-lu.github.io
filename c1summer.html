title: Capital One Software Engineering Internship
---
     Over the summer, I worked on a natural language processing (NLP) & machine learning (ML) project at Capital One. 
     The purpose of this project was to organize Capital One datasets, so that the datasets were easily accessible. 
     This involved: creating keywords/tags and descriptions based on the dataset's content. 
     Since Capital One owned a vast collection of datasets, we automated this process using ML.

     I was in charge of dataset description validation. I used a preprocessing library, called SpaCy, to look at the existing descriptions' characteristics.
     After looking at characteristics such as: similarity, financial relevance, and grammatical correctness, my program categorized descriptions as either good or bad.
     Then, good descriptions are fed into our GPT-2 model to autocomplete C1 dataset descriptions.

     Programming Languages, Libraries, Tools Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, SpaCy, Pandas, Docker
