  Storyboard is an app where writers can share & edit their stories, connect with the writing community, and complete challenges. This was created with Kotlin in Android Studio. My team (of two other people) also used Google Firebase.

Key Functionality
</br>User login system. Each user has their own profile where they can list their published stories. 
</br>Story Focused. Users can create, edit, publish, view, and comment on stories.
</br>Community. Users can check out other users profiles and suggested public works.
</br>Weekly Challenges. To inspire writers, the app creates interesting prompts and word count challenges. The users can then submit specific works to these challenges. They can also view the other works submitted to each challenge.
