title: Capital One Part-Time Software Engineering Internship
---
    During the fall, I worked on a Jira API project called Autodialer.
As a bank, Capital One has a lot of compliancy standards to follow. Instead of manually identifying & issuing compliance problems, Autodialer automates this process. 
</br> </br>
For the Autodialer project, I used a few of Capital One’s API’s to gather data across different sources. After scraping html, JSON, and CSV files, I organized the data into a Pandas dataframe. 
After getting data about Capital One’s applications, I used Python to check if the applications passed certain constraints. This helped determine if applications were compliant or not. 
If application services did not meet compliance, Autodialer would use the Jira API to create new issues and assign them to the correct user. 
</br> </br>
Through this internship, I gained experience working with API’s and data. 
In particular, this was the first intern project where I had to handle missing data:
</br> 
Ideally, Autodialer would assign compliance issues to the engineering lead of a specific application. However, often times the engineering lead was missing in the datasets. Thus, I had to help create a hierarchy of users to assign the compliance issue to.

Programming Languages, Libraries, Tools Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, JIRA API, C1 APIs, Pandas, Docker
