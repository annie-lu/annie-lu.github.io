   When I use the Internet, I don’t (usually) consider how fast and how far information travels. However, using traceroute, a computer network command, I can track these connections/communication. I send a request from my computer to access a website. From there, the packets of data travel to the site’s physical location, or data center, to establish a connection. Some of these data packets travel cross borders and oceans, through underwater cables. 

     </br>
   </br>
  For instance, WeChat, a messaging app I use to talk to my parents, is located in Shenzhen, China. Coming from University of Maryland, College Park the packets travel to multiple data centers and points of presence. Here’s the following traceroute:

Here you can see the Internet interacts with water and the sea. It goes across the country, across the Pacific Ocean, to Hong Kong then Shenzhen, China. Knowing that <a href="http://he.net/3d-map/" class="green">Hurricane Electric </a>, it’s possible the data travels through the Asia-America Gateway Cable System-- from San Luis Obispo, California to Lantau Island, Hong Kong. There seems to be a large amount of locations and places for this connection to go wrong: on land, in air, under sea. Physical dangers, like natural disasters or sea level rising seem imminent, yet there's never been an extended time where this WeChat app failed me. This shows how resilient the Internet can be.

Here, the globe shows the current cable networks of the world, with a sea level rising (10ft) projection overlayed onto it. This shows a new problem arising: water. While some cables are meant to be underwater, the endpoints/data centers are not. 
</br>  </br>
Currently, our internet infrastructure is being maintained and improved upon. Eventually, internet infrastructure must adapt to these sea level, geographical changes as well.
